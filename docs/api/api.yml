  description: |
    This document specifies the Bag Index Service API. It provides relational metadata about items in the bag stores.
    This API implements the operations `GET` on the paths `/`, `/bag-sequence?contains=:UUID`, `/search?doi=:DOI` and `/bags/:UUID` and implements the operation PUT on `/bags/:UUID`
    It is not neccessary for this service to supply the bag store the bag is stored in.

            The request was rejected by the bag-index. The reason will be included in the response entity. Some possible causes are:

            * The bag has already been added to the index.
            * The UUID was syntactically incorrect.
            * The bag could not read, and may have been corrupt.
            * The DOI could not be found in the bag's metadata.
            * Bag-info.txt contains an invalid Is-Version-Of identifier tag.
