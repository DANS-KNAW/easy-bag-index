The RPM will install the binaries to /opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-bag-index and the configuration files to /etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-bag-index . To install the module on systems that do not support RPM, you can copy and unarchive the tarball to the target host. You will have to take care of placing the files in the correct locations for your system yourself. For instructions on building the tarball, see next section. BUILDING FROM SOURCE \u00b6 Prerequisites: Java 8 or higher Maven 3.3.3 or higher RPM Steps: git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/easy-bag-index.git cd easy-bag-index mvn install If the rpm executable is found at /usr/local/bin/rpm , the build profile that includes the RPM packaging will be activated. If rpm is available, but at a different path, then activate it by using Maven's -P switch: mvn -Pprm install .
